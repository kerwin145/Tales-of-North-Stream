# Tales-of-North-Stream

Hello, welcome to Tales of North Stream, my first space-shooter game!

I followed the tutorial series from 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXImR8Wm53M&list=PLWms45O3n--6KCNAEETGiVTEFvnqA7qCi&ab_channel=RealTutsGML

The features of: 
Game loops, sprite rendering, player and enemy (called Glorpnorp) movement, bound collisions, fireball shooting and collisions, spawning system, menu systme, mouse input,
and health bar
were derived fom the tutorial

Features I added on my own include:
Currency, multidirectoinal fireball shooting, score, upgrade menu with upgradable health, fireball reload, fireball speed, and fireball pierce, 6 abilities, 3 of which can
be equipped at the same time, and 3 bosses. 

The main class can be found in the src folder, and is named "Game."

Feel free to download!
